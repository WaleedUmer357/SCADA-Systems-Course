 SCADA Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of hands-on SCADA projects completed as part of a comprehensive SCADA course at Griffith University. All projects were implemented using Schneider Electric SCADAPack x70, programmed in RemoteConnect, and visualised using EcoStruxure™ GeoSCADA / ClearSCADA (ViewX).

The focus of these projects is on industrial automation, power systems monitoring, process control, fault handling, and operator-centric HMI design.
